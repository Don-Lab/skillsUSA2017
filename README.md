# Skills USA 2017 Website
This is the website that I created that won 1st place at Kentucky's Skills USA Web Design competition.
## Process
Since the bus had arrived late to the competition site, we had approximately 5 hours to create the website. I was on a team with a graphic designer. We utilized the parallax website design. We were tasked with making a websie for a non-profit organization, this one was Big Brother Big Sisters.
